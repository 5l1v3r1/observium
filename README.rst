Observium (www.observium.org)
=============================================

Observium is an autodiscovering SNMP based network monitoring platform written in PHP 
which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and operating systems 
including Cisco, Linux, HP, Dell, FreeBSD, Juniper, Brocade, Netscaler, NetApp and many more.

Observium has grown out of a lack of network monitoring platforms which are both simple to 
manage and pleasant to use. It is intended to provide a navigable interface to the health 
and performance of your network. Its design goals include collecting as much historical 
data about devices as possible, using as much auto-discovery as possible with little or 
no manual intervention, and having a very intuitive interface.
